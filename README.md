My humble OOP homework.
I kind of wanted to do more in terms of validation, but I will keep my head low and accept my fate!!!
And it might be a bit...as we say - "дървено", but it motivates me (annoys me to the point of crying...jk..unless) to optimise it properly!
Still I did my best at the moment, so I am proud...
